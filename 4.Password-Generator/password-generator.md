# Password Generator

Probably the most easiest thing i have ever done, though always a little tricky at the start. In my last project I tought i would use the <b>Regexp</b> but i didnt had to use it, but i guess if i was implmenting a password strength validator i might have used it,


### Conclusion

I didnt actaully have any key take away this time but, at least i did something. The next project i am going to build I dont know for now.
