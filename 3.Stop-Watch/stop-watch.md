# Stop Watch

Again, i considerd this as a breakthrough. In this project i learned alot, and alot of Javascrip concept, in this project i built the stop watch and included functionality like laps, start, stop, resume, and reset. Probably not the easiest project to build, but at the end its really easy. 

At first i didnt even knew where to start, but after suffing the internet like everyone those, i got a head start, and Voila its done.

## Key Take Away

- In this project i made use of template literals very well, and did alot of manipulation in the template,  think that is called Interpolation
- Also DOM manipulation is what i actually did in this project, thought DOM manipulation isn't actually my aim for this project but i did and understand it it was intresing.
- But the most inportant thing in this project is handling time, and the use of Javascript time methods like this below, among others
``` 
setInterval(() => {}, time) 
clearInterval(interval)
```
- One very or let me say most important take awayi would like to tell myself is that documentation is my best friend

### Conclusion

Completing this project will make it three project i have done in total, its realy amazing moving on to the next one, and that will be ...<b>Password Generator</b>. Today and before i have learnt and saw things called <b>Regexp</b>, But i dont really know what is it and how to work with it. so in this next project i think i sure will be able to use Regexp in building the calculator, this will brush up my skills and knowledge in working with strings and Regexp. Next project is available at [Password Generator](../4.Password-Generator/)
