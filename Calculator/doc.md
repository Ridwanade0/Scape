# Calculator
I jut built this calculator to test my knowledge with, javascript, in the end it wanst professional either way still looked like an amatuer code. I dont even totaly understand what i wrote. 

But at least this the first actuall code i wrote in javascript that is really natural and show what i have known.

## Key Take Away

Here are the key take aways for this project so as to prepare for the next one and know what else needs to learn and improve on.

- I need to further understand array and and string datatypes and method, this is the same thing i did when solvig leet code 3 days ago, i just have or let me say need more undertsnading of the data types. This will help me understand how to handle data more efficienlty and correctly
- Code flow, i need to better understand how code are executed and how memory is managed, this will allow me to understand what is current in teh memory. This is what i meant e.g in a loop i need to better understand what are the current values, also in an arrays
- I need to undersatnd tenary operation
- Also how arritemetic works in programming jsut needs to brush up a littl bit.

### Conclusion

This project that i did shows i still have a long way to go with programming language there are a lot i have to understand, and i need to always try as much as i can to solve more problem and do more projects as it will gives me more understanding on the programming lanaguage and improve my problem solving capabilities.

Next project coming on, in this next project i will build a <b>Rock Paper Scissors</b> game, i guess this isn't as complex and hard as building a calculator, actually i can say that because i have built that before, though i followed a tutorial video when doing that. so Next up is <b>Rock Paper Scissor</b>!
