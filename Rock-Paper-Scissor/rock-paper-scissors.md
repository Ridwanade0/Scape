# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Yeah, probaly one of the simplest javascript project or game to build, though can be tricky, even though i have built this before now, still got me something to worry about.

 What i learnt doing this project is actually very great.

## Key Take Away

- Again in thi project i had to use array, meaing array is a very important data type, and i need to defineatly make sure i work on that more
- Carefull debugging, i learnt that when i properly sat down and debugg my code line by line, things tend to work out much better.
- when  building this project the only bug i encounter was tricky, and it was about string conversion, here is what happend on the DOM the user guess that was returned as a upper case letter but i am comparing with lower cases which make the computer always wins, since if all the condition not matched it will default to <b>lose</b>
- One finall key take away is code organization, in this project i managed to rganize my code a little bit that the calculator game that i build if not much difference thought, well you can check it out here [Calculator](../Calculator)

### Conclusion

My conlcusion is while i am trying to build this small project getting even more understanding on teh programming language. well see you in my next project check it out here its going to be a <b>Stop watch</b> [Stop Wacth](../Stop-Watch)
