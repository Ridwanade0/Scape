# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Yeah, probaly one of the simplest javascript project or game to build, though can be tricky, even though I have built this before now, still got me something to worry about.

 What I learnt doing this project is actually very great.

## Key Take Away

- Again in thi project I had to use array, meaing array is a very important data type, and I need to defineatly make sure I work on that more
- Carefull debugging, I learnt that when I properly sat down and debugg my code line by line, things tend to work out much better.
- When  building this project the only bug I encounter was tricky, and it was about string conversion, here is what happend on the DOM the user guess that was returned as a upper case letter but I am comparing with lower cases which make the computer always wins, since if all the condition not matched it will default to <b>lose</b>
- One finall key take away is code organization, in this project I managed to rganize my code a little bit that the calculator game that I build if not much difference thought, well you can check it out here [Calculator](../Calculator)

### Conclusion

My conlcusion is while I am trying to build this small project getting even more understanding on teh programming language. well see you in my next project check it out here its going to be a <b>Stop watch</b> [Stop Wacth](../Stop-Watch/)
